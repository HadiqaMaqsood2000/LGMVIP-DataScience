1) Import all required libraries.

2) Load the downloaded provided dataset

3) Split the dataset into each word in order but without the presence of some special characters.

4) Perform the feature engineering, For this purpose, create a dictionary with each word in the data within the list of unique words as the key, 
and itâ€™s significant portions as value. 

5) Define a Word length which will represent the number of previous words that will determine our next word. 
I will define prev words to keep five previous words and their corresponding next words in the list of next words.

6) Create two numpy arrays x for storing the features and y for storing its corresponding label. x and y will iterate if the word is available so that the corresponding position becomes 1

7) Look at a single sequence of words.

8) Build Recurrent Neural network using LSTM model, which is a very powerful RNN.

9) Train the next word prediction model with 20 epochs.

10) Save this model for future use.

11) Look at how our model is behaving based on its accuracy and loss changes while training. 

12) Build a python program or functions to predict the next word using in trained model. 

13) Declare some sequence of quotes that is used as a base for predictions.

14) Finally, use the model to predict the next word.
