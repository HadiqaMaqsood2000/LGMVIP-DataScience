Level: Intermediate

1) The only library we need for converting an image into a pencil sketch with Python is an OpenCV library in Python.
Letâ€™s import it to get started with the task.

2) Now the next thing to do is to read the image.

3) After reading the image, we will create a new image by converting the original image to greyscale.

4) Now the next step is to invert the new grayscale image.

5) In next step in the process is to blur the image by using the Gaussian Function in OpenCV.

6) After that invert the blurred image. 

7) Then the final step is to convert the image into a pencil sketch.

8) In last, have a look at both the original image & the pencil sketch image.
